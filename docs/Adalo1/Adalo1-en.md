## What is Adalo?
- [Adalo](https://www.adalo.com/) is a no-code tool from the United States. It allows you to develop applications without programming.
- You can create an app by selecting the parts you want to use from those provided and dragging and dropping them onto the screen.
- You can develop not only web apps(to be displayed in a browser), but also smartphone apps for Android and iOS. It is also possible to publish the developed application on Google Play and AppStore.

- To create a Chart, we need to prepare a database, which will be explained in the next lecture.
- This time, paste the Chart image instead of using actual chart.
  - I'll share the Chart image with you via Slack.
  (You can also take a screenshot of the image on the right and use it)

- Add an Image from ADD COMPONENT and upload the Chart image.

Set up a link from the pet detail screen to the weight record screen.
- Set up a link to the weight record screen with "Click Action" of the Group containing "Text:'Weight Log'" in the pet detail screen.

Let's preview the screen.

The weight record screen seems OK.

We have created all UI for the sample app :tada:

#### URL for cloning
- You can clone the application from the following URL, and use it to check completed version.

## Exercise
- Create your own screen that will be the transition destination for "Link 2" on the pet details screen.
- Alternatively, you can create a new app as you like.

When you are ready, share the URL on Slack to make it available for everyone.

#### Notes about the exercise
- Components and Screens named "xxxxList" may be difficult to use because they need to be connected to the database, which will be explained in the next lecture.
  - If you face a problem and can't solve by yourself, I recommend you to avoid using "xxxxList" for today.
- While the NoCode tool allows you to create apps easily, it may not allow you to achieve complex UI and functions.
  - If you are stuck, think about how you can achieve what you want to do with a simple UI and functions.
    - For example: Avoid including too many components in one screen(separate them into multiple screens).

#### Presentation of exercise results
(If there is enough time)

Would you like to present the app you made in the exercise?

## Summary
- In this lecture, we learned about Adalo and created the UI of the pet health management application.
  - We used only simple components that do not require a database.
- In the next lecture, we will continue to use Adalo to build a database that matches the UI we created today, and make it possible to manipulate data from the app. 
  - By using a database, various functions can be realized and the UI can be easily created. I hope you'll enjoy it!

# That's all!
