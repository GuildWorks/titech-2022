## What is No-Code Development?
No-code development is the development of apps and web services without writing code in a programming language.

Compared to traditional application development (scratch development) using programming language, no-code development can often develop an application in a shorter amount of time.


Even if you are not an engineer with programming knowledge, no-code development makes it possible to create an app.


---
There are many tools available for no-code development.

Each of them has different features, but they all have in common the idea of making it easy to develop an application as imagined without writing any code. Many tools allow you to create screens by combining already completed parts by drag and drop, allowing you to develop apps intuitively.

Many no-code development tools also provide an environment for running the developed app, so you can check the operation immediately after modifying it and proceed with development quickly, repeating trial-and-error quickly.

## Advantages and disadvantages of no-code development
### Advantages
- No programming knowledge required
- No cost to order engineers
- Fast development of apps.


---
### Disadvantages
- When you want to do something complicated, it may be difficult to achieve it.
  - While simple functions allow for easy development, in many cases it can only be done in a routine manner, which limits what can be achieved compared to writing code to create an app. (In some cases, this can be solved by combining multiple tools.)
- You will be dependent on the no-code development tool you use.
  - Depending on the tool you use, there may be restrictions on design, functionality, etc. Also, if the tool is no longer in service, you will be forced to stop your service (or not be able to modify your app anymore).

---
## Why No-Code Development?
- Because it is possible to develop a prototype that can actually be operated by users without spending a lot of time or money, and it is a quick and easy way to validate service ideas.
- Compared to traditional application development (scratch development), there are fewer points at which you get stuck, so it is easier and more enjoyable for beginners :smile:

## What kind of no-code development tools are available?
I mentioned earlier that "there are many tools available for no-code development," but how many are there?

---
The NoCode Chaos Map created by the NoCoders Japan Association listed 155 (maybe) tools.

---
With so many tools to choose from, you may be at a loss as to which one to choose. The key to choosing the right one is to think about what you want to create, because each no-code development tool has different type of app that are easy to create.

Examples of what you want to make are as follows.
- Mobile apps
- Web apps
- Web site
- EC site
- Business efficiency tools

## Introduction of No-Code Development Tools used in Programming Boot Camp.
In the Programming Boot Camp, we will be lecturing on two no-code development tools.

- Adalo
  - Adalo is easy to use and can easily develop simple mobile apps.
- Bubble
  - Bubble has a lot of features and can be used to create a variety of things, but it is a bit difficult to use.

First, experience no-code app development with the easy-to-understand Adalo. Next, learn how to use the versatile Bubble.

Let's move on to the lecture on Adalo, the first no-code development tool.
